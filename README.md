# ChunkFixer
**ChunkFixer** is a simple plugin I made in 5 minutes to help a guy out with a problem in his server where 5k chunks were loaded and weren't unloading. Weird. 

## Usage

### `/fixworld <world>`
* Permission: `ChunkFixer.main`

That's it! Super simple (just iterates over loaded chunks and attempts to unload them).
